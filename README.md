Stable Roommates Algorithm Implementation
This repository contains an implementation of the Stable Roommates algorithm, also known as Irving's algorithm, in C. The algorithm is designed to find a stable matching between individuals based on their preferences.

Overview
The Stable Roommates algorithm is a classic algorithm used to solve the stable matching problem, where a group of individuals each have preferences over potential partners, and the goal is to pair them up in a stable manner where no individual prefers another individual over their assigned partner.

Features
Reads preferences from a CSV file.
Implements the Stable Roommates algorithm to find a stable matching.
Saves the resulting matching pairs to a CSV file.
